{"name":"BF3 Tools","body":"### Welcome to BF3 Tools.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://d.pr/i/Esor+)\r\n\r\n \r\nThis app was my first project on iOS, so I mainly used it as a learning experience. It uses ARC and Storyboards, which I saw as the way to go when I began writing it, since I wasn't bothered about backwards compatibility with <iOS 5.0. To clone this repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd destination\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:mathieuhendey/BF3-Tools.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nIt includes comprehensive information about every aspect of Battlefield 3, including detailed over-head views of maps, weapon descriptions with statistics, an overview of each class, description and statistics for each vehicle, and dog tag, medal, ribbon and assignment descriptions including detailed images and unlock requirements for each one. I also recently added a BF3Stats.com stats view, whose thunder was largely stolen by the simultaneous release of an official Battlelog app from EA.","tagline":"BF3 Tools iPhone app","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
